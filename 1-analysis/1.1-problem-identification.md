# 1.1 Problem Identification

## The Need for Video Games:

Video games have become increasingly popular in the recent years. It's market size value is exopected to grow by around 12.9% from 2022 - 2030 <mark style="color:blue;">(</mark>_<mark style="color:blue;">Video Game Market Size & Share Growth Report, 2030</mark>_<mark style="color:blue;">, n.d.)</mark>. The predominant reason for this is obviously the Covid-19 pandemic, which began on January 10th 2020 and is expected to end around May 11th 2023. Throughout this timeframe, there has been multiple lockdowns keeping civillians in their homes, which has resulted in a dramatic increase in the use of the internet, and online games. Studies found that '62% of adults played video games during the pandemic' <mark style="color:blue;">(Waterson, 2021)</mark>.&#x20;

Due to this dramatic increase of gamers, I would like to create a simple platformer game, similar to that of Super Mario Bros, Space Invaders and Pacman. I believe that this style of game would be exceedingly popular due to the low processing power required to play them. Retro games often have simple gameplay principles that are simple to learn but tricky to master and as they advance through the game, this gives players a satisfying sense of progression and accomplishment. Retro games also frequently place an emphasis on high scores, which often motivates players to play the game repeatedly in an effort to surpass their prior best. This would therefore allow gamers to play on almost any device, seeing that it is able to access the internet, and be able to compete with their friends/classmates/colleagues to achieve the highest score.
