# 1.1 Problem Identification

## The Need for Video Games:

Video games have become increasingly popular in recent years. Its market size value is expected to grow by around 12.9% from 2022 - 2030 [<mark style="color:blue;">(“Video game market size & share growth report, 2030,” n.d.)</mark>](../reference-page.md). The predominant reason for this is the COVID-19 pandemic, which began on January 10th 2020 and is expected to end around May 11th 2023. Throughout this timeframe, multiple lockdowns have kept civilians in their homes, which has resulted in a dramatic increase in the use of the internet and online games. Studies found that '62% of adults played video games during the pandemic' [<mark style="color:blue;">(Waterson, 2021)</mark>](../reference-page.md).

Due to this dramatic increase in gamers, I would like to create a simple platformer game, similar to that of Super Mario Bros, Space Invaders and Pacman. I believe that this style of game would be exceedingly popular due to the low processing power required to play them. Retro games often have simple gameplay principles that are simple to learn but tricky to master and as they advance through the game, this gives players a satisfying sense of progression and accomplishment. Retro games also frequently place an emphasis on high scores, which often motivates players to play the game repeatedly in an effort to surpass their prior best. This would therefore allow gamers to play on almost any device, seeing that it can access the internet, and be able to compete with their friends/classmates/colleagues to achieve the highest score.



Studies show that people play computer games due to 3 main, motivational components: 'There is the achievement component, which includes the want to advance in the game, the interest in the rules and system of the game, and the want to compete with others. Next is the social component, which is the want to form connections with others, liking to chat and help other players, and the want to be a part of a group effort. Last, there is the immersion component, which is creating and customising a character to play in the unique story of the game as well as wanting to escape from real life' [<mark style="color:blue;">(Pang, 2017)</mark>](../reference-page.md).

The graph below shows a survey which was taken in the U.S. in August 2022. From this, we can see that most gamers play computer games to either pass their free time, as a stress relief, hobby or to challenge themself. The platformer game which I will be making would easily fit this criterion since it is challenging, not too long of a game (therefore people would be able to play it whenever they have a minute of free time) and would also grant satisfaction to the user upon level completion / new high scores.

Lastly, I will make my game free to play. This should allow a larger demographic of gamers to enjoy the game since no 'investment' is needed to start having fun. My game achieves its goal of being entertaining by not having a cost because then, players aren't obliged to play because they paid for it and want to get their money's worth. Tree, appel&#x20;
