## PEGI Ratings:

To help parents decide which games and apps are suitable for their children, many games are age-rated using the PEGI system. The PEGI grading takes into account a game's age suitability rather than its difficulty. The recommended minimum age at which a game should be played is indicated by its ratings (see image below).

### Target Demographic:

A results table from a 2022 survey shows that Action Platform games are most popular with gamers aged from 25-34 years old [<mark style="color:blue;">(Clement, n.d.)</mark>](../reference-page.md). This means that I will be able to add anything into my rogue-lite game since there wouldn't be any age restrictions for gamers of this age. However, I still wish to keep the PEGI Rating as low as possible to encourage those of younger ages to play too. I estimate that my project will be rated at PEGI 7 or at PEGI 12 since it will include 'violence'. This may be in the form of shooting guns, using baseball bats, punching and kicking. Although, this violence will be 'non-realistic' and 'non-detailed' which should allow my project to have a lower rating, like PEGI 7 for example.

### Example Ratings:

Some good examples of PEGI 12 games are: Overwatch and Fortnite. Both of these games are classed as 'third person shooters' since they are very combat focussed.

* According to a rating board website, Fortnite was rated PEGI 12 due to 'frequent mild violence\` [<mark style="color:blue;">(“Video standards council ratings board,” n.d.)</mark>](../reference-page.md). This is probably due to its more realistic features and graphics. The weapons from Fortnite are quite realistic and it also involves life-like physics (gun recoil etc). Below, you can see an image of a typical weapon from Fortnite and the real life version.

You can see that the Fortnite version of the commonly known 'AK-47', is extremely similar to the real thing. Clearly this is a major factor as to why the PEGI rating is so high. Because of this, I will probably use very unrealistic looking weapons to my game so that younger audiences are able to play.&#x20;

* Overwatch on the other hand, was classed as 'non-realistic-looking violence' [<mark style="color:blue;">(“Overwatch,” n.d.)</mark>](../reference-page.md). This is what I would be hoping for my game to be classed as. If we take a look at the weapons used in overwatch games, they differ massively to the ones used in Fortnite (see below).

Evidently, using less-realistic weapons in my game would be the right path to take since I hope to have as low of a PEGI rating as possible. This will directly affect the theme of my game and will push me towards a futuristic, alien scenario.
