### Overview:

Super Mario Bros. is a classic 2D side-scrolling platform game developed and published by Nintendo in 1985. As Mario and his brother Luigi go through the Mushroom Kingdom to free Princess Toadstool from Bowser's clutches, the game follows their adventures.

Players take on the role of Mario or Luigi and have to make their way through levels that are full with foes, barriers, and power-ups. Eight worlds with four stages each make up the game, which concludes with a fight with Bowser (a final boss).

Many classic components of the video game industry were first introduced by Super Mario Bros., including opponents like Goombas and Koopa Troopas as well as power-ups like the Super Mushroom and Fire Flower. The sound effects and music from the game are also iconic and have come to define the franchise.

Super Mario Bros uses extremely basic and straightforward controls. It was most generally played on the Nintendo Entertainment System (more commonly known as the NES). As you can see from the image below, the NES used a small, wired controller which housed four buttons and a 'D-Pad'.

Players who are easily disheartened after a few failed attempts should be able to pick up the game pretty quickly due to the straightforward game controls. They will be able to play the game for sustained amounts of time and not give up after a few failed efforts because of this. Furthermore, the basic design targets younger audiences rather well, since the controls are so simple to grasp.

| Simple game controls     | Simple game controls will allow all players to pick up the game reasonably quickly. This should allow the widest possible playerbase to get involved with the game. I aim to use around five or six control keys in my game. This should also make it easier for me to code. |
| Range of Levels and Maps | Providing a range of maps and levels should make each run/session of my game unique and interesting. However, it will be extremely time consuming to develop different background styles.                                                                                    |

| Timer   | Super Mario Bros includes a timer wich gives you a time limit for each level. I would prefer to leave each level with no time limit to give those who are younger and therefore maybe worse at the game a chance to still progress without having to spend hours practicing the game. However, I may need to include one if the game is too  |

### Overview:

The game follows a little girl named Madeline as she climbs Celeste Mountain. She encounters a variety of obstacles along the trip, including hazardous terrain, dangerous environmental conditions, and mystical monsters. As they progress through each level, the player can accurately guide Madeline's movements due to the game's unique design.

Through Madeline's challenges and successes, the game examines issues of mental health, self-discovery, and personal development.

As in Super Mario Bros, Celeste uses very simple game controls which allows gamers of all different experience to enjoy the game straight away. There is a total of seven keys / buttons used to govern Madeline's movement and actions. Due to it's simplicity, it is very popular with younger audiences. From a survey on reddit, I found that the majority of the playerbase are aged from 12-18  [<mark style="color:blue;">(</mark>_<mark style="color:blue;">Hello Celeste Peopleâ€¯: R/Celestegame</mark>_<mark style="color:blue;">, n.d.)</mark>](../reference-page.md).

| Plethora of Levels / Challenges | I intend to make my game challenging, but I don't wish for it to be too time consuming. I found that for 100% completion in Celeste, it takes around thirty seven hours of gameplay [<mark style="color:blue;">(</mark>_<mark style="color:blue;">How Long Is Celeste?</mark>_<mark style="color:blue;">, n.d.)</mark>](../reference-page.md). I am aiming for my game to take significantly less time to complete.  |
| Climb / Dash abilities          | In Celeste, Madeline is able to utilise specific climb and dash abilities. This is not a feature which I intend to include in my game.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
