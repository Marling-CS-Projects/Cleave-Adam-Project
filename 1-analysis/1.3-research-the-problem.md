### Overview:

Super Mario Bros. is a classic 2D side-scrolling platform game developed and published by Nintendo in 1985. As Mario and his brother Luigi go through the Mushroom Kingdom to free Princess Toadstool from Bowser's clutches, the game follows their adventures.

Players take on the role of Mario or Luigi and have to make their way through levels that are full with foes, barriers, and power-ups. Eight worlds with four stages each make up the game, which concludes with a fight with Bowser (a final boss).

Many classic components of the video game industry were first introduced by Super Mario Bros., including opponents like Goombas and Koopa Troopas as well as power-ups like the Super Mushroom and Fire Flower. The sound effects and music from the game are also iconic and have come to define the franchise.
