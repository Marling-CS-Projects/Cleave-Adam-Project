### Overview:

Super Mario Bros. is a classic 2D side-scrolling platform game developed and published by Nintendo in 1985. As Mario and his brother Luigi go through the Mushroom Kingdom to free Princess Toadstool from Bowser's clutches, the game follows their adventures.

Players take on the role of Mario or Luigi and have to make their way through levels that are full with foes, barriers, and power-ups. Eight worlds with four stages each make up the game, which concludes with a fight with Bowser (a final boss).

Many classic components of the video game industry were first introduced by Super Mario Bros., including opponents like Goombas and Koopa Troopas as well as power-ups like the Super Mushroom and Fire Flower. The sound effects and music from the game are also iconic and have come to define the franchise.

Super Mario Bros uses extremely basic and straightforward controls. It was most generally played on the Nintendo Entertainment System (more commonly known as the NES). As you can see from the image below, the NES used a small, wired controller which housed four buttons and a 'D-Pad'.

Players who are easily disheartened after a few failed attempts should be able to pick up the game pretty quickly due to the straightforward game controls. They will be able to play the game for sustained amounts of time and not give up after a few failed efforts because of this. Furthermore, the basic design targets younger audiences rather well, since the controls are so simple to grasp.

| Simple game controls     | Simple game controls will allow all players to pick up the game reasonably quickly. This should allow the widest possible playerbase to get involved with the game. I aim to use around five or six control keys in my game. This should also make it easier for me to code. |
| Range of Levels and Maps | Providing a range of maps and levels should make each run/session of my game unique and interesting. However, it will be extremely time consuming to develop different background styles.                                                                                    |

| Timer   | Super Mario Bros includes a timer wich gives you a time limit for each level. I would prefer to leave each level with no time limit to give those who are younger and therefore maybe worse at the game a chance to still progress without having to spend hours practicing the game. However, I may need to include one if the game is too  |

| Feature      | Justification                                                                                                                            |

| Multi-Player | I would like to keep the game to one player only. Having multiple players would likely be sufficiently more difficult to code / program. |
