### Overview:

Super Mario Bros. is a classic 2D side-scrolling platform game developed and published by Nintendo in 1985. As Mario and his brother Luigi go through the Mushroom Kingdom to free Princess Toadstool from Bowser's clutches, the game follows their adventures.

Players take on the role of Mario or Luigi and have to make their way through levels that are full with foes, barriers, and power-ups. Eight worlds with four stages each make up the game, which concludes with a fight with Bowser (a final boss).

Many classic components of the video game industry were first introduced by Super Mario Bros., including opponents like Goombas and Koopa Troopas as well as power-ups like the Super Mushroom and Fire Flower. The sound effects and music from the game are also iconic and have come to define the franchise.

### Controls:

Super Mario Bros uses extremely basic and straightforward controls. It was most generally played on the Nintendo Entertainment System (more commonly known as the NES). As you can see from the image below, the NES used a small, wired controller which housed four buttons and a 'D-Pad'.

Players who are easily disheartened after a few failed attempts should be able to pick up the game pretty quickly due to the straightforward game controls. They will be able to play the game for sustained amounts of time and not give up after a few failed efforts because of this. Furthermore, the basic design targets younger audiences rather well, since the controls are so simple to grasp. Below, you can see a table with the controls and respective buttons:

I aim to use around five or six control keys in my game. This should also make it easier for me to code. |

## Celeste

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption><p><a href="../reference-page.md"><mark style="color:blue;">(</mark><em><mark style="color:blue;">Celeste Cover Image</mark></em><mark style="color:blue;">, n.d.)</mark></a></p></figcaption></figure>

### Overview:

Celeste is a critically acclaimed platform game developed by Canadian independent studio Matt Makes Games. It was released in 2018 for multiple platforms including the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

The game follows a little girl named Madeline as she climbs Celeste Mountain. She encounters a variety of obstacles along the trip, including hazardous terrain, dangerous environmental conditions, and mystical monsters. As they progress through each level, the player can accurately guide Madeline's movements due to the game's unique design.

Celeste is renowned for its meaningful tale and likeable characters in addition to its realistic gameplay. Through Madeline's challenges and successes, the game examines issues of mental health, self-discovery, and personal development. This game is popular with fans of platformers and independent games because of its striking pixel art, appealing soundtrack, and engaging gameplay.

### Controls:

As in Super Mario Bros, Celeste uses very simple game controls which allows gamers of all different experience levels to enjoy the game straight away. There is a total of seven keys / buttons used to govern Madeline's movement and actions. Due to it's simplicity, it is very popular with younger audiences. From a survey on reddit, I found that the majority of the player base are aged from 12-18  [<mark style="color:blue;">(“Hello Celeste people : R/celestegame,” n.d.)</mark>](../reference-page.md). Below, you can see a table with the controls and respective buttons:

| Climb Ability.                   | In Celeste, Madeline is able to utilise specific climb and dash abilities.

## Sonic the Hedgehog

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (3).png" alt=""><figcaption><p><a href="../reference-page.md"><mark style="color:blue;">(</mark><em><mark style="color:blue;">Sonic the Hedgehog Classic</mark></em><mark style="color:blue;">, n.d.)</mark></a></p></figcaption></figure>

### Overview:

Classic video game series Sonic the Hedgehog was created by Sonic Team and released by Sega. In order to defeat Dr. Eggman and save the world, Sonic, a blue animated hedgehog, must make his way through a variety of levels in the game.

Sonic the Hedgehog's gameplay is centred on speed, with Sonic's rapid running and jumping being the key element. While avoiding numerous hazards and opponents, players must collect rings and power-ups. Over the years, new characters and features have been introduced to the game's many sequels and spin-offs.

With subsequent releases of merchandise, an animated TV series, and even a feature film, Sonic the Hedgehog has become a cultural phenomenon. Numerous additional games have been impacted by the franchise, which is still well-liked by both longtime and new fans.

### Controls:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p><a href="../reference-page.md"><mark style="color:blue;">(</mark><em><mark style="color:blue;">Arcade Machine</mark></em><mark style="color:blue;">, n.d.)</mark></a></p></figcaption></figure>

Sonic the Hedgehog was played on either the Sega Mega-Tech or the Sega Mega-Play systems (see below). The controls used for the game were very simple since each action had a dedicated button which meant that desired actions could be completed instantly. These types of games systems were very popular in the 1990s and many arcade clubs were set up as a result of this. Below, you can see a table with the controls and respective buttons:

| Control                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Action                  |
