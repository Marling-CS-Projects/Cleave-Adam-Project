# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Features of my Proposed Solution to the issue described in [<mark style="color:blue;">1.1 Problem Identification</mark>](1.1-problem-identification.md)

### Features:

<details>

<summary>Two Dimensional, Side Scrolling View.</summary>

The game which I would like to develop will be a 2D platform, side scroller. This is due to the fact that 2D games provide the players with a unique perspective of the events and also, it doesn't require any powerful hardware to run.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Simple Controls.</summary>

I will definitely include rather basic game controls to allow younger audiences to grasp the game with ease. However, the game will get harder over time so therefore, it should not be too easy to complete and still allow a unique experience for older players.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Timer.</summary>

I have decided that I will be including a timer in my game. This will help me to create a more competitive atmosphere while playing and further allow players to contend with friends and other gamers.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Multiple Maps and Levels.</summary>

Including a range of environments for my game will allow each user experience to be unique and exiting. The different environments may include: forests, deserts, jungles and cities. Unfortunately, creating these different maps may take a large amount of time so I might only be able to include a couple of the listed concepts.

</details>

### Limitations:

<details>

<summary>Multiplayer.</summary>

I believe that including a multiplayer aspect to my game would be too complicated and take a significantly greater amount of time to implement. I would like to keep it simple and single player, similar to Sonic and Celeste.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Graphics</summary>

Since I aim to make this game availiable for as many gamers as possible, the graphics quality will be rather low. This should allow for many people to play the game, on almost any device, since there are no high power computing components required. Unfortunately, this may take away from the user's experience, but not too much since the game is focused on combat rather than schenery and visuals.
