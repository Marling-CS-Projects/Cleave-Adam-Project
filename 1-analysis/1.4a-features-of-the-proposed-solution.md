### Features:

{% tab title="2D View." %}
### Two Dimensional, Side Scrolling View

The game which I would like to develop will be a 2D platform, side scroller. This is due to the fact that 2D games provide the players with a unique perspective of the events and also, it doesn't require any powerful hardware to run.

The game will focus the player in the centre of the screen and follow them as they move across the landscape. This should influence a sense of consistency throughout the experience. Furthermore, the player is forced to explore and travel deeper into the environment in order to complete the level. This plays nicely into the exploration aspect which many gamers love, similar to that of Sonic the Hedgehog (see below).

{% tab title="Controls." %}
### Simple Game Controls

I will definitely include rather basic game controls to allow younger audiences to grasp the game with ease. However, the game will get harder over time so therefore, it should not be too easy to complete and still allow a unique experience for older players.

At the moment, each player movement action will have a dedicated key. This technique has been used for years and is very popular. Below is the list of keys I will be using:

| Control Key                 | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A & D                       | The 'A' and 'D' keys will be used to move the character left and right respectively. These keys should be comfortable for the user since your left hand usually rests on those keys. I expect that the player will use their ring-finger to press the 'A' key and their index-finger to press the 'D' key.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| W & S                       | <p>The 'W' and 'S' keys will be used to move the character upwards and downwards respectively. Again, these keys should be comfortable for the user since your left hand usually rests on those keys. I expect that the player will use their middle-finger to press both the 'W' and the 'S' key. This is because the user will not need to press both keys at the same time, therefore allowing their middle-finger to move back and fourth.<br><br>This configuration shouldn't be too difficult to grasp since most computer games today reserve the W,A,S and D keys for movement. I have chosen to use these keys instead of the arrow keys because "the arrow keys are not ergonomic to use in conjunction with a right-handed mouse." <a href="../reference-page.md"><mark style="color:blue;">(Contributors to Wikimedia projects, 2023)</mark></a></p> |
| Left Mouse Click & Spacebar | I have decided that both Left Mouse Click and the Spacebar will perform the character's attack. These keys have been selected because once again, these are the most common keys used for attacking. Additionally, the spacebar is really easy to access since you generally always have a thumb or finger resting on it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Timer." %}
### Timer

I have decided that I will be including a timer in my game. This will help me to create a more competitive atmosphere while playing and further allow players to contend with friends and other gamers.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Maps & Levels." %}
### Multiple Maps and Levels

Including a range of environments for my game will allow each user experience to be unique and exiting. The different environments may include: forests, deserts, jungles and cities. Unfortunately, creating these different maps may take a large amount of time so I might only be able to include a couple of the listed concepts.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Opponents." %}
### Opponents

I have chosen to add two different types of opponents to my game, a ranged opponent and a melee opponent.

The melee opponent will be very similar to the 'Goomba' from Super Mario Bros. I like the way that they move and have decided that it will fit the game well. 'Goombas' move by sliding left and right until the hit a border, at which point, they 'bounce' and change direction (see YouTube link below). In Super Mario Bros, they do this infinitely until they are defeated - the player makes Mario jump onto it's head.  As opposed to that, I will be adding a hitbox and giving them a health stat, also removing the 'jump on head' method to defeat them. This should entice the player into melee combat with the Goomba like foe. Similarly to Super Mario Bros, the Goomba like foe will&#x20;

Developing an enemy like this should portray a sense of danger while playing the game.&#x20;

### Limitations:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Multiplayer." %}
### Multiplayer

I believe that including a multiplayer aspect to my game would be too complicated and take a significantly greater amount of time to implement. I would like to keep it simple and single player, similar to Sonic and Celeste. Additionally, I think that it would be difficult for multiple players to use the same computer. This would cause problems with the key bindings, the coding and with the player experience. Furthermore, this could create multiple bugs in the game - like a mix up between the player's characters and controls - meaning that it would take much longer to produce a clean, fully functioning game.&#x20;

Alternatively, I could add two renders of the same game and have each control set dedicated to one render of the game. However, I still sure that this will still cause too much confusion for both players. Also, rendering two versions of the same game may cause some user's computers to struggle, lag and skip frames. This is not the experience I wish to create so will consequently not be including multiplayer.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Graphics." %}
### Graphics Quality

Since I aim to make this game availiable for as many gamers as possible, the graphics quality will be rather low. This should allow for many people to play the game, on almost any device, since there are no high power computing components required. Unfortunately, this may take away from the user's experience, but not too much since the game is focused on combat rather than schenery and visuals.

In addition to to this, I have no experience of graphic design so producing sprites, textures and graphics may prove to be a challenge. Therefore, by reducing the game's graphics quality, I won't have to spend as much time focussed on the graphics.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Saving." %}
### Saving Progress

A further limitation of my game is the fact that user's progress will not be saved between sessions. Consequently, player's data will be wiped after closing the page. This is due to the fact that including a data saving method would be far too complex to include in the short time frame which I am provided with. However, this should not pose too much of an issue since the levels should all be fairly simple and not to time consuming to complete. Also, players could contend against each other based upon the timer, rather than by game completion.
