### Features:

{% tab title="2D View." %}
### Two Dimensional, Side Scrolling View

The game which I would like to develop will be a 2D platform, side scroller. This is due to the fact that 2D games provide the players with a unique perspective of the events and also, it doesn't require any powerful hardware to run.

The game will focus the player in the centre of the screen and follow them as they move across the landscape. This should influence a sense of consistency throughout the experience. Furthermore, the player is forced to explore and travel deeper into the environment in order to complete the level. This plays nicely into the exploration aspect which many gamers love, similar to that of Sonic the Hedgehog (see below).

### Simple Game Controls

I will definitely include rather basic game controls to allow younger audiences to grasp the game with ease. However, the game will get harder over time so therefore, it should not be too easy to complete and still allow a unique experience for older players.

At the moment, each player movement action will have a dedicated key. This technique has been used for years and is very popular. Below is the list of keys I will be using:

| Control Key                 | Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A & D                       | The 'A' and 'D' keys will be used to move the character left and right respectively. These keys should be comfortable for the user since your left hand usually rests on those keys. I expect that the player will use their ring-finger to press the 'A' key and their index-finger to press the 'D' key.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| W & S                       | <p>The 'W' and 'S' keys will be used to move the character upwards and downwards respectively. Again, these keys should be comfortable for the user since your left hand usually rests on those keys. I expect that the player will use their middle-finger to press both the 'W' and the 'S' key. This is because the user will not need to press both keys at the same time, therefore allowing their middle-finger to move back and fourth.<br><br>This configuration shouldn't be too difficult to grasp since most computer games today reserve the W,A,S and D keys for movement. I have chosen to use these keys instead of the arrow keys because "the arrow keys are not ergonomic to use in conjunction with a right-handed mouse." <a href="../reference-page.md"><mark style="color:blue;">(Contributors to Wikimedia projects, 2023)</mark></a></p> |
| Left Mouse Click & Spacebar | I have decided that both Left Mouse Click and the Spacebar will perform the character's attack. These keys have been selected because once again, these are the most common keys used for attacking. Additionally, the spacebar is really easy to access since you generally always have a thumb or finger resting on it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

{% tab title="Timer." %}
### Timer

I have decided that I will be including a timer in my game. This will help me to create a more competitive atmosphere while playing and further allow players to contend with friends and other gamers.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Maps & Levels." %}
### Multiple Maps and Levels

Including a range of environments for my game will allow each user experience to be unique and exiting. The different environments may include: forests, deserts, jungles and cities. Unfortunately, creating these different maps may take a large amount of time so I might only be able to include a couple of the listed concepts.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Limitations:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Multiplayer." %}
I believe that including a multiplayer aspect to my game would be too complicated and take a significantly greater amount of time to implement. I would like to keep it simple and single player, similar to Sonic and Celeste.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Graphics." %}
Since I aim to make this game availiable for as many gamers as possible, the graphics quality will be rather low. This should allow for many people to play the game, on almost any device, since there are no high power computing components required. Unfortunately, this may take away from the user's experience, but not too much since the game is focused on combat rather than schenery and visuals.
