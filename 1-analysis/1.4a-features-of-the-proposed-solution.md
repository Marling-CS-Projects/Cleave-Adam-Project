# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Features of my Proposed Solution to the issue described in [<mark style="color:blue;">1.1 Problem Identification</mark>](1.1-problem-identification.md)

### Features:

<details>

<summary>Two Dimensional, Side Scrolling View.</summary>

The game which I would like to develop will be a 2D platform, side scroller. This is due to the fact that 2D games provide the players with a unique perspective of the events and also, it doesn't require any powerful hardware to run.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Simple Controls.</summary>

I will definitely include rather basic game controls to allow younger audiences to grasp the game with ease. However, the game will get harder over time so therefore, it should not be too easy to complete and still allow a unique experience for older players.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Timer.</summary>

I have decided that I will be including a timer in my game. This will help me to create a more competitive atmosphere while playing and further allow players to contend with friends and other gamers.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Multiple Maps and Levels.</summary>



</details>

### Limitations:

<details>

<summary>Multiplayer.</summary>

I believe that including a multiplayer aspect to my game would be too complicated and take a significantly greater amount of time to implement. I would like to keep it simple and single player, similar to Sonic and Celeste.
