### Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation:

Thinking abstractly in computer science refers to the ability to understand and reason about complex concepts and systems without getting bogged down in the details of how they are implemented. This requires the ability to analyze problems at a high level, identify key patterns and relationships, and develop solutions that can be generalized and applied in a variety of different contexts.

Visualization in computer science refers to the process of creating visual representations of complex data, algorithms, or systems to aid in understanding and analysis. This can involve creating diagrams, charts, graphs, or other visualizations that highlight key patterns or relationships within the data or system being analyzed. Visualization is an important tool for computer scientists, as it can help to identify trends or anomalies that might be difficult to see through other means, and can lead to new insights and discoveries.



### Thinking Ahead:

Thinking ahead in computer science means anticipating future problems and designing flexible and adaptable software solutions that can accommodate change. It requires an understanding of system architecture and design principles to prevent technical debt and reduce development costs.



### Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition:

Thinking procedurally in computing involves breaking down complex problems into manageable steps, while decomposition is the process of breaking down a system into smaller modules. Both skills are essential for computer scientists to develop algorithms and software that can solve complex problems efficiently.



### Thinking Logically:

Thinking logically in computer science refers to the ability to reason and make decisions based on a set of rules, principles, or conditions. This involves using formal logic to analyze and evaluate arguments, and to determine whether a given statement or conclusion is true or false. Logical thinking is essential for designing and implementing software, as it helps to ensure that code is correct, efficient, and free from errors. It is also important for problem-solving, as it enables computer scientists to develop algorithms and approaches that are both effective and scalable.



### Thinking Concurrently:

Thinking concurrently in computer science refers to the ability to design and implement software systems that can perform multiple tasks or processes simultaneously. This requires an understanding of parallelism and concurrency, as well as the ability to manage shared resources and coordinate the execution of multiple threads or processes. Concurrent thinking is essential for developing scalable, high-performance software systems that can handle large amounts of data or users, and is becoming increasingly important as modern computing architectures become more complex and distributed.
