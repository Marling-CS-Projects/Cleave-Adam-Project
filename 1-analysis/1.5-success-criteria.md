| ID | Criteria                                                                                                                                         | Justification                                                                                                                                                         | Reference                                                                          |

| 1  | Each level should have a clear design and structure, allowing the User to clearly understand the objective.                                      | This should reduce any confusion that the User may encounter while playing the game, hence improving the experience.                                                  | [1.4a Maps and Levels](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#maps-and-levels.) |
| 2  | Easy-to-use game controls should be implemented to assist with the User's experience. Using common keybindings such as WASD.                     | The WASD keys are often used in video games. Therefore, Users may already be familiar with the controls, allowing them to get a grasp of the game in less time.       | [1.4a Controls](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#controls.)               |
| 3  | User perspective should closely follow the game character across the level. Implementing the side scrolling view to relate to retro style games. | Utilising a side scrolling view will mimic a retro style game to further enhance the User experience,                                                                 | [1.4a 2D View](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#2d-view.)                 |
| 4  | The game should run smoothly and should not crash too often.                                                                                     | Games which crash very frequently can be extremely frustrating to play and can create negative impressions. Games which stutter and do not run smoothly also do this. | [1.4a Graphics](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#graphics.)               |

### Non-functional

These are features which are not descriptions of functionality. They are more like suitability, such as age rating appropriateness, or performance of algorithms/response times for UI etc.
