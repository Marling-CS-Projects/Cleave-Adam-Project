| 1  | Each level should have a clear design and structure, allowing the User to clearly understand the objective.                                      | This should reduce any confusion that the User may encounter while playing the game, hence improving the experience.                                                  | [1.4a Maps and Levels](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#maps-and-levels.)  |
| 2  | Easy-to-use game controls should be implemented to assist with the User's experience. Using common keybindings such as WASD.                     | The WASD keys are often used in video games. Therefore, Users may already be familiar with the controls, allowing them to get a grasp of the game in less time.       | [1.4a Controls](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#controls.)                |
| 3  | User perspective should closely follow the game character across the level. Implementing the side scrolling view to relate to retro style games. | Utilising a side scrolling view will mimic a retro style game to further enhance the User experience,                                                                 | [1.4a 2D View](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#2d-view.)                  |
| 4  | The game should run smoothly and should not crash too often.                                                                                     | Games which crash very frequently can be extremely frustrating to play and can create negative impressions. Games which stutter and do not run smoothly also do this. | [1.4a Graphics](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#graphics.)                |
| 5  | The game opponents should be sufficiently animated and designed so that they are distinguishable from eachother and the player's character.      | Having distinguishable characters in my game will be key, this is because it will allow the player to react accordingly depending on the foes that they encounter.    | [1.4a Opponents](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#opponents.)              |
| 6  | The game enemies should track the player's character and attack it automatically once it is within range.                                        | Having enemies which are automatically hostile will force the player to engage with the opponents and develop their combat skills in the game.                        | [1.4a Opponents](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#opponents.)              |
| 7  | The game should include a fully functioning health bar to inform the user of their character's health level.                                     | Health bars can be very important to take into account when making in game decisions.                                                                                 | [1.4a Player Character](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#player-character) |

| 21       | The game should not include any content which will exceed a PEGI rating of 7. | I will only include 'unrealistic violence' in my game. This should allow me to keep it to a PEGI 7 to broaden my playerbase. | [1.2 PEGI Ratings](1.2-stakeholders.md#pegi-ratings) |
