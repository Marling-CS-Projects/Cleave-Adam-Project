# 2.2.1 Cycle 1

## Design

### Objectives

In the first cycle, my objectives are to create the html webpage and then to add the layers and sprites. Completing the steps in this order should lay out a strong, progressive structure for my game. The layers don't need to be too detailed at this point, graphics quality improvements can be adjusted later on.

* [x] Set up the HTML and Javascript in Visual Studio Code
* [ ] Set up the layers on the screen
* [ ] Implement boundaries
* [x] Add the player (can be a simple shape for now)
* [x] Implement gravity into the game

### Usability Features

Implementing my simple game controls into the project. This will allow the user to move their character around the map.

Contrasting colours will be used to show clear boundaries and will help me to split the development into specific sections.
