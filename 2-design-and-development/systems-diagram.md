# 2.1 Design Frame

## Systems Diagram:

This diagram shows the different parts of the game that I will focus on creating. I have split each section into smaller sub-sections. Throughout the development stage, I will pick one or two of these sections to focus on at a time to gradually build up and piece together the game. I have broken the project down this way as it roughly corresponds to the success criteria displayed in [<mark style="color:blue;">1.5 Success Criteria</mark>](../1-analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md).

## Usability Features:

Usability is an important aspect to my game as I want it to be accessible to as many people as possible. Key usability points are evidenced in [<mark style="color:blue;">1.4a Features of Proposed Solution</mark>](../1-analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md) and in [<mark style="color:blue;">1.5 Success Criteria</mark>](../1-analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md).

### Effective

Users can achieve the goal with completeness and accuracy. To do this, I will make it easy for the players to realise that they need to reach a goal in order to complete a level. I will make this goal clear to see so there is no confusion over where the players need to go. Therefore, making the game more enjoyable.

#### Aims

* Create a clear goal to reach to determine the end of a level.
* Clear depiction of enemies to emphasise hostility.

### Efficiency

The speed and accuracy with which a user can complete the goal. To do this, I will create a menu system which is easy to navigate through in order to find what you are looking for. The information which is more important can be found with fewer clicks.

#### Aims

* Create a menu system that is quick and easy to navigate through.
* Create a control system that isn't too complicated but allows the player to do multiple actions.

### Engaging

The solution is engaging for the user to use. To do this, I will create 2 levels to keep the player engaged and allow them to have fun while playing the game. Using vector-style art will also make the game nicer to look at than blocks, so may include additional details, keeping them engaged.

#### Aims

* Create a couple of levels to work through.
* Incorporate a style of game art that suits the game.

### Error Tolerant

The solution should have as few errors as possible and if one does occur, it should be able to correct itself. To do this, I will write my code to manage as many different game scenarios as possible so that it will not crash when someone is playing it.

#### Aims

* The game doesn't crash.
* The game does not contain any bugs that damage the user experience.

### Easy To Learn

The solution should be easy to use and not be overly complicated. To do this, I will create simple controls for the game. I will make sure that no more controls are added than are needed in order to keep them as simple as possible for the players.

#### Aims

* Create a list of controls for the game.
* Implement clear and familiar game controls to ease playability.
