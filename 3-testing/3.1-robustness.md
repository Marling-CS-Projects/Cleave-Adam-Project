# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

Find success criteria that relate to function and robustness

| Criterion | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Result      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| 1         | Collision detection will the stop the player's character from leaving the map and entering out of bounds areas. This will also be necessary since there will be gravity in the game to make it more realistic.                                                     | As expected |
| 3         | The game enemies should track the player's character and attack it automatically once it is within range. The Twines will have a much longer range than the Grunts, since the Grunts will be stuck moving in between boundaries and the Twines will be stationary. | As expected |
| 9         | The game should run smoothly and should not crash too often.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | As expected |
