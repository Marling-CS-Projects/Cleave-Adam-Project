# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

Find success criteria that relate to function and robustness

| Criterion | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Result      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| 3         | The game enemies should track the player's character and attack it automatically once it is within range. The Twines will have a much longer range than the Grunts, since the Grunts will be stuck moving in between boundaries and the Twines will be stationary. | As expected |
| 9         | The game should run smoothly and should not crash too often.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | As expected |
| 12        | The game should not include any content which will exceed a PEGI rating of 7.                                                                                                                                                                                      | As expected |

### Criterion 3

### Criterion 9

For this test, I decided to try and put the game under as much stress as possible. This included unusual inputs and trying to do things that the page wasn't prepared for. This test turned out to be particularly useful since it highlighted some key bugs in my programming. These issues are listed below:

1. The teleporters couldn't be used to travel backwards through the maps. I wanted the user to experience true freedom in the game and therefore had to fix this problem.
2. If timed correctly, you are able to balance on top of the Grunts. You'll then be carried by them without dying.



### Criterion 12

For this test, I decided to use [<mark style="color:blue;">https://pegi.info/what-do-the-labels-mean</mark>](https://pegi.info/what-do-the-labels-mean) to ensure that my game was appropriate for the specified audience. As expected, my game passed this test with no problems.
