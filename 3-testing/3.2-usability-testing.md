# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess:

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Were you able to understand how to complete the game without guidance? Were you able to complete the levels without much practice?           |
| 2 - Efficient      | Was it simple to get into the game, did you understand how the controls worked?                                                              |
| 3 - Engaging       | Do you like playing the levels? Would you play it again? Do you like the art style in the game?                                              |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Did you encounter any errors when playing the game? Did the game crash or run at a very low FPS? If there were any bugs how many were there? |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Did you find the game easy to understand? Would you have preferred a more in-depth user guide and a gameplay walkthrough?                    |

Upon completion of the development process, the game was distributed to some of my peers along with a survey form which evaluated the above criteria. Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation



| Test           | Criteria | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Effective      | 5        | Each level should have a clear design and structure, allowing the User to clearly understand the objective.                                 |
| Efficient      | 10       | Easy-to-use game controls should be implemented to assist with the User's experience. Using common keybindings such as WASD.                |
| Engaging       | 6        | Bright, vivd colours should be used to create an emphasis on important game factors.                                                        |
| Engaging       | 7        | The game opponents should be sufficiently animated and designed so that they are distinguishable from eachother and the player's character. |
| Error Tolerant | 1        | There should be functioning collision detection implemented into the game.                                                                  |
| Error Tolerant | 9        | The game should run smoothly and should not crash too often.                                                                                |
| Easy to Learn  | 10       | Easy-to-use game controls should be implemented to assist with the User's experience. Using common keybindings such as WASD.                |

## Effective:

### Criterion 5

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This was a very important question to ask my peers. As all of them answered with a 5 which meant 'very obvious'. Therefore, I would say that I successfully completed the 5th item in [<mark style="color:blue;">1.5 Success Criteria</mark>](../1-analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md).

### Criterion 10

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This survey question shows a spread of answers. However, they are mostly centered towards the 'very entertaining' side of the graph. Overall, I am really happy with this response since I spent a lot of time working of the simplicity of the game, making it accessible and easy for everyone.

### Criterion 6

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

From the answers collected above, my game was clearly engaging as I intended. I believe that a reason for this was because of the vibrant colours used. One of the comments I had read 'The game was hard enough, simple to control and colourful' and another stated that 'I liked the colour schemes used, they made the game more interesting and helped me differentiate between the opponents'. Clearly, the game was very engaging for the users.

### Criterion 7

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The results collected from this survey strongly showed that the enemies were clearly defined in comparison to the rest of the maps. Therefore, I believe that I successfully completed the 7th item in [<mark style="color:blue;">1.5 Success Criteria</mark>](../1-analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md).

### Criterion 1

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Most of the reponses I recieved stated that either 'no' errors were found or '1-2' errors were found in my game. Those responses with higher numbers contained descriptions like 'The jump was on a cool down' or 'Grunts wouldn't go towards the player' which were not errors but parts of the game's design. Consequently, I am happy that most players had a flawless experience.

### Criterion 9

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I am very pleased with the survey results for this question. Clearly the game runs smoothly as intended, therefore passing the 9th item in [<mark style="color:blue;">1.5 Success Criteria</mark>](../1-analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md).

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria:

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 12        | The game should not include any content which will exceed a PEGI rating of 7.         |
| 13        | The game utilises an appropriate soundtrack which adds to the experience of the game. |
| 14        | The game should mitigate boredom.                                                     |

### Criterion 12

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The chart above shows the results collected from my peers. It is clealy shown that everybody agreed that there was no inappropriate content in my game. Therefore, it meets the thresholds to be a Pegi 7 game.



### Criterion 13

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The chart above shows the results collected from my peers. Overall, the responses suggest the the soundtrack was catchy. This implies that it enhanced the user experience and made the game more enjoyable to play.



### Criterion 14

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The graph above shows the results collected from my peers. Most of my peers answered with a 4 or 5 which meant 'very entertaining'. Consequently, the game reduces boredom which was the exact aim of Criterion 14. I then asked the other responders what modifications should be made to make it more entertaining, they mostly responded with adding more levels.
