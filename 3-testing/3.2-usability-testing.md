# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Were you able to understand how to complete the game without guidance? Were you able to complete the levels without much practice?           |
| 2 - Efficient      | Was it simple to get into the game, did you understand how the controls worked?                                                              |
| 3 - Engaging       | Do you like playing the levels? Would you play it again? Do you like the art style in the game?                                              |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Did you encounter any errors when playing the game? Did the game crash or run at a very low FPS? If there were any bugs how many were there? |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Did you find the game easy to understand? Would you have preferred a more in-depth user guide and a gameplay walkthrough?                    |

Upon completion of the development process, the game was distributed to some of my peers along with a survey form which evaluated the above criteria. Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation



| Test           | Criteria | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Effective      | 5        | Each level should have a clear design and structure, allowing the User to clearly understand the objective.                                 |
| Efficient      | 10       | Easy-to-use game controls should be implemented to assist with the User's experience. Using common keybindings such as WASD.                |
| Engaging       | 6        | Bright, vivd colours should be used to create an emphasis on important game factors.                                                        |
| Engaging       | 7        | The game opponents should be sufficiently animated and designed so that they are distinguishable from eachother and the player's character. |
| Error Tolerant | 1        | There should be functioning collision detection implemented into the game.                                                                  |
| Error Tolerant | 9        | The game should run smoothly and should not crash too often.                                                                                |
| Easy to Learn  | 10       | Easy-to-use game controls should be implemented to assist with the User's experience. Using common keybindings such as WASD.                |

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                                                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 12        | The game should not include any content which will exceed a PEGI rating of 7.         |
| 13        | The game utilises an appropriate soundtrack which adds to the experience of the game. |
| 14        | The game should mitigate boredom.                                                     |

### Criterion 12

The chart above shows the results collected from my peers. I have been informed by the respondant who answered 'Yes', that the response was a misclick and that they should have responded with 'No'. Therefore, everybody agreed that there was no inappropriate content in my game and that it meets the thresholds to be a Pegi 7 game.



### Criterion 13

The chart above shows the results collected from my peers. Overall, the responses suggest the the soundtrack was catchy. This implies that it enhanced the user experience and made the game more enjoyable to play.



### Criterion 14

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The graph above shows the results collected from my peers. Most of my peers answered with a 4 or 5 which meant 'very entertaining'. Consequently, the game reduces boredom which was the exact aim of Criterion 14. I then asked the other responders what modifications should be made to make it more entertaining, they mostly responded with adding more levels.
