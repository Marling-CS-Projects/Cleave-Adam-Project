| 1 - Effective      | Were you able to understand how to complete the game without guidance? Were you able to complete the levels without much practice?           |
| 2 - Efficient      | Was it simple to get into the game, did you understand how the controls worked?                                                              |
| 3 - Engaging       | Do you like playing the levels? Would you play it again? Do you like the art style in the game?                                              |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Did you encounter any errors when playing the game? Did the game crash or run at a very low FPS? If there were any bugs how many were there? |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Did you find the game easy to understand? Would you have preferred a more in-depth user guide and a gameplay walkthrough?                    |
