# 3.3 Checking Development Tests

For 3.3 Checking Development Tests, I decided to run my game and test all of the development aspects again. In the event that no change is present, I will show the testing evidence as displayed in my development cycles.

## Cycle 1 - Player and Boundaries

| Test | Instructions  | What I expect                                             | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code.     | The game to start, boundaries rendered, player placed.    | Pass      |
| 2    | Watch player. | The player is pulled downwards due to artificial gravity. | Pass      |

## Cycle 2 - Movement

| Test | Instructions                     | What I expect                                                                    | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code.                        | The game to start, boundaries still rendered and player still placed.            | Pass      |
| 2    | Movement keys: WASD are pressed. | The player is able to move in all directions. This includes the ability to jump. | Pass      |

## Cycle 3 - Jumping and Perspective

| Test | Instructions                       | What I expect                                                                               | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code.                          | The game to start, boundaries rendered, player and Grunt placed.                            | Pass.     |
| 2    | Both jump keys repeatedly pressed. | The Player's character is unable to fly upwards and has a short cooldown between each jump. | Pass.     |
| 3    | Movement keys pressed.             | Camera to closely follow the Player's character to keep them centered on the screen.        | Pass.     |

### Evidence

```javascript
// Define jump() function
function jump() {
	// these 2 functions are provided by body() component
	if (player.isGrounded()) {
		player.jump(jumpForce)
	}
}


// Jump when 'space' is pressed
let jumpProcedure = false;

onKeyDown("space", () => {
  if (!jumpProcedure) {
    jumpProcedure = true;
    // run jump function
    jump();
    // wait duration
    wait(0.8, () => {
      jumpProcedure = false;
    });
  }
});

// Jump when 'up' is pressed

onKeyDown("up", () => {
  if (!jumpProcedure) {
    jumpProcedure = true;
    // run jump function
    jump();
    // wait duration
    wait(0.8, () => {
      jumpProcedure = false;
    });
  }
});
```



```javascript
// Viewpoint

player.onUpdate(() => {
	// Set the viewport center to player.pos
	camPos(player.worldPos())
})

player.onPhysicsResolve(() => {
	// Set the viewport center to player.pos
	camPos(player.worldPos())
})
```

## Cycle 4 - First Level

| ---- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code.    | The game to start, player placed into tropical environment for first level. | Pass      |

| 1    | Run code.                                      | The game to start, boundaries rendered, player and Grunt placed. | Pass      |
| 2    | Collide the Player's character with the Grunt. | The Player loses the game and the game is reset.                 | Pass      |
