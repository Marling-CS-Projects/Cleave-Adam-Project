| 1         | There should be functioning collision detection implemented into the game.                                                                                                                                                                                         | [<mark style="color:blue;">2.2.1 Cycle 1 - Player and Boundaries</mark>](../2-design-and-development/cycle-1.md)                                                                                                                    |
| 2         | User perspective should closely follow the game character across the level. Implementing the side scrolling view to relate to retro style games.                                                                                                                   | [<mark style="color:blue;">2.2.3 Cycle 3 - Jumping and Movement</mark>](../design-and-development/cycle-1-2.md)                                                                                                                     |
| 3         | The game enemies should track the player's character and attack it automatically once it is within range. The Twines will have a much longer range than the Grunts, since the Grunts will be stuck moving in between boundaries and the Twines will be stationary. | <p><a href="../design-and-development/cycle-1-4.md"><mark style="color:blue;">2.2.5 Cycle 5 - Grunts</mark></a><br><a href="../design-and-development/cycle-1-8.md"><mark style="color:blue;">2.2.9 Cycle 9 - Twines</mark></a></p> |
| 4         | The character should be able to move around the map, their actions controlled by the User's keystrokes.                                                                                                                                                            | [<mark style="color:blue;">2.2.2 Cycle 2 - Movement</mark>](../design-and-development/cycle-1-1.md)                                                                                                                                 |



## Design and Aesthetics

| 5         | <p>A total of 2 levels, both with contrasting environments. The first will have a tropical environment and the second will have a desert tundra style environment.</p><p></p><p>Each level should have a clear design and structure, allowing the User to clearly understand the objective.</p> | <p><a href="../design-and-development/cycle-1-3.md"><mark style="color:blue;">2.2.4 Cycle 4 - First Level</mark></a><br><a href="../design-and-development/cycle-1-6.md"><mark style="color:blue;">2.2.7 Cycle 7 - Second Level</mark></a></p> |
| 6         | Bright, vivd colours should be used to create an emphasis on important game factors.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [<mark style="color:blue;">3.2 Usability Testing</mark>](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md)                                                                                                                                                |
| 7         | The game opponents should be sufficiently animated and designed so that they are distinguishable from eachother and the player's character.                                                                                                                                                     | [<mark style="color:blue;">3.2 Usability Testing</mark>](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md)                                                                                                                                                |
| 8         | The game should include a fully functioning health bar to inform the User of their character's health level.                                                                                                                                                                                    | Unfortunately, there was not enough time for this feature to be added to the game. However, due to this I adapted my game so that enemies and spikes kill the player in one hit. This also made the game more fast paced.                      |



## Game Performance and User Interface

| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 9         | The game should run smoothly and should not crash too often.                                                                 | [<mark style="color:blue;">3.2 Usability Testing</mark>](../3-testing/3.2-usability-testing.md)                                                                                                               |
| 10        | Easy-to-use game controls should be implemented to assist with the User's experience. Using common keybindings such as WASD. | [<mark style="color:blue;">2.2.2 Cycle 2 - Movement</mark>](../design-and-development/cycle-1-1.md)                                                                                                           |
| 11        | Simple, easy-to-navigate game menu.                                                                                          | Unfortunately, there was not enough time for this feature to be added to the game. However, due to this I adapted my game so that it is easy to understand and runs repeatedly until the user wishes to quit. |
