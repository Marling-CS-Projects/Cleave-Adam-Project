# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                                  | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1           | The levels should have clear structures and designs.         | Success      |
| 2           | The User should be able to understand the objective clearly. | Success      |



### Feature 1 - Completely Met

The levels each have a comprehensible layout which allows the User to progress through them with ease. In the future, this may be tweaked to make the finish points less clear or hidden.

### Feature 2 - Completely Met

The game objective is clearly defined for the User, this should allow them to complete the level without confusion or significant amounts of problem solving. In the future, the complexity of levels will be increased to make the User think harder about how to reach the objective.



## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                                                                | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Easy-to-use game controls implemented to provide cross-game compatibility. | Success      |



### Feature 1 - Completely Met

Popular control keys are utilised to allow cross-game familiarity between controls. This should help the User to pick up the game quickly and get playing faster than random or unusual key bind choices. In the future, these keys will stay the same. Additional features such as special movements and attacks would be bound to similar popular keys. For example; space bar, left ctrl, left shift, mouse buttons.



## Engaging

| Feature No. | Description                                                                               | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Vivid colour scheme used to captivate User and hook attention.                            | Success      |
| 2           | Enemies are sufficiently animated to be distinguishable from backgrounds and environment. | Success      |



### Feature 1 - Completely Met

Contrasting colours were used in order to make certain game aspects stand out. In future levels, environments will contain more bright schemes in order to represent change and variance in the game. This will help to remove repetition and should keep the User entertained.

### Feature 2 - Completely Met

Enemies contrasted with their environments. This made them clearly distinguishable. In future development, enemies will be added that blend into the environment and are harder to spot. This will add a suspense aspect to the game which will enhance the User's experience.



## Error Tolerant - Completely Met

| Feature No. | Description                                                              | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1           | Functional collision detection should be implemented.                    | Success      |
| 2           | The game shouldn't crash too often and should run smoothly at all times. | Success      |

### Feature 1 - Partially Met

The collision detection was critical since it kept the game functional and working as intended. This would be kept the same for any future developments. There were however a few bugs flagged up in the survey concerning collisions in specific places in the levels.

### Feature 2 - Completely Met

There were no crashes while my game was running. This shows that it is working as intended and that the feature has been met accordingly. In future developments, this should not change and the game should continue to not crash or drop frames.



## Easy To Learn

| Feature No. | Description                                                                | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Easy-to-use game controls implemented to provide cross-game compatibility. | Success      |

### Feature 1 - Completely Met

The majority of the respondents from my survey stated that the game was very easy to just 'pick up and play'. This is just how it was intended to be so therefore, this should not be altered or tweaked in future developments.
