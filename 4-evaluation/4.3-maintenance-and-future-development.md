# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of the Project

* Offline support - The game can only be played if the user has a steady internet connection.
* Platform availability - The game can not be played on mobile, a personal computer with suitable hardware is required (see [<mark style="color:blue;">1.6 Hardware and Software Requirements</mark>](../1-analysis/1.6-hardware-and-software-requirements.md)).
* Content - The game only contains two levels which while the game is challenging, could get repetitive.
* Solo game mode - The game is single-player only so two people cannot compete against each other simultaneously.

These limitations would hopefully be addressed under future developments and therefore improve the game significantly, allowing the game to grow and adapt towards the perfect game.

## Maintenance

The game is rather easy to maintain. The only real maintenance work that would be incurred would be in the form of bug fixes. This would take place after large developments or significant adaptations are made.

## Short-Term Development

### Bug Fixes:

At the start of future development, all bugs flagged up by Survey Participants and during my testing would need to be fixed to ensure a seamless User experience. Listed below are the bugs that have been discovered including a short description of how to fix them:

* Looping music - When the coin was collected multiple times, the music would overlap. This could be fixed by stopping the music each time the Player's character dies. Therefore resetting a boolean value.
* Clipping error at spawn - By the sprite's spawn point, there was a reported issue where if you held against the wall and jumped, the sprite would clip its head on the block somehow. This could be fixed by adjusting the block's hitboxes or by changing the grass block to a different shape.
* Spike hitbox being too big - Some players reported that the spike hitboxes were too big and that therefore the game was extremely difficult to complete. This could be amended by reducing the size of their hitboxes slightly.

### Levels:

Adding more levels to my game would make it significantly more interesting. This is because the User would have a variety of unique scenarios making game completion more of a challenge. All of the colour themes would continue to be contrasting and distinctive in order to hold the User's attention.

### Testing:

Once all of these fixes and adjustments had been made, they would need to be put through another stage of testing to ensure that there were no further errors created. Afterwards, there are two different pathways which the game could take, it could either be left as it is to grow. Or, the game could be pushed onto Longer-Term aspects detailed below.

## Long-Term  Limitations of the Project

* Web-based platform - the game will need to be transferred to a downloadable application instead of a web app.
* Single difficulty, no cheats - the game should incorporate various difficulty modes in order to allow those with less experience or familiarity to still progress through the game without too much extra practice.
* &#x20;Graphics and animations - because my game is developed in a web-based editor, it is extremely hard to implement animations and detailed graphics.
* 2D Platformer - the game would remain a 2D platformer and therefore the same side-scrolling perspective would be used indefinitely.
