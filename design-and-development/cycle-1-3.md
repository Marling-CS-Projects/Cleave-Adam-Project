# 2.2.4 Cycle 4

## Design

### Objectives

In the fourth cycle, my objectives are to implement the first level into the game. Completing the steps in this order should lay out a strong, progressive structure for my game. The level doesn't need to be too detailed at this point, graphics quality improvements can be adjusted later on.

* [ ] Implement the first level design.
* [ ] Utilise basic colours to depict a tropical environment as specified in [<mark style="color:blue;">1.5 Success Criteria</mark>](../1-analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md).

### Usability Features

Implementing my tropical level design into the project. This will allow the user to become more engaged in the game as discussed in [<mark style="color:blue;">1.5 Success Criteria</mark>](../1-analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md).



### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use |
| ------------- | --- |
|               |     |

### Pseudocode

```
```

## Development

### Outcome

* The player is now placed into a tropical environment for the first level, the code for this can be viewed below:

```javascript
```

### Challenges

Some challenges I faced during this cycle:

* Finding the correct blocks to create a tropical appearance.

## Testing

Tests performed in this cycle are evidenced below, they were a crucial aspect to my development.

### Tests

| Test | Instructions | What I expect                                                                                          | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code.    | The game to start, boundaries still rendered, player placed into tropical environment for first level. | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    |              |                                                                                                        | As expected           | Pass      |

### Evidence

The screenshot below shows the rendered sprite after moving from its original position, it completes the following tasks for this cycle:

* [ ] Implement the first level design.
* [ ] Utilise basic colours to depict a tropical environment as specified in [<mark style="color:blue;">1.5 Success Criteria</mark>](../1-analysis/1.5-success-criteria.md).
