# 2.2.5 Cycle 5

## Design

### Objectives

In the fifth cycle, my objectives are to implement hostile enemies into the game. For now, I will only be adding the Grunt as detailed in [<mark style="color:blue;">1.4a Features of Proposed Solution</mark>](../1-analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#opponents). At this point, the Grunts don't need to be too detailed, a simple shape or image will do.

* [ ] Add Grunts as specified in [<mark style="color:blue;">1.4a Features of Proposed Solution</mark>](../1-analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#opponents).
* [ ] Grunts should damage or kill the player.

### Usability Features

The Player will have to avoid the Grunts since they will cause the Player's character to end the game. This will add excitement into the game since there is now a risk factor.



### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use |
| ------------- | --- |
|               |     |

### Pseudocode

The pseudocode for the hostile Grunts is shown below:

```
```

## Development

### Outcome

* The player is now faced will the Grunt opponents when the game begins, the code for this can be viewed below:

```javascript
```

### Challenges

Some challenges I faced during this cycle:

* The Grunts movement was difficult to implement because they wouldn't comply with the gravity which was set.

## Testing

Tests performed in this cycle are evidenced below, they were a crucial aspect to my development.

### Tests

| Test | Instructions | What I expect                                                    | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code.    | The game to start, boundaries rendered, player and Grunt placed. | As expected           | Pass      |

### Evidence

The screen recording below shows the rendered sprite after moving from its original position, it completes the following tasks for this cycle:

* [x] Add Grunts as specified in [<mark style="color:blue;">1.4a Features of Proposed Solution</mark>](../1-analysis/1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#opponents).
