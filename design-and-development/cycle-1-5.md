# 2.2.6 Cycle 6

## Design

### Objectives

In the sixth cycle, my objectives are to clean up and comment my existing code. This will be useful when debugging in the future. I am also going to implement the transition to the next level, it doesn't have to be detailed for now, a simple platform will do.

* [x] Comment and tidy up code.
* [ ] Implement a basic change to the next platform.

### Usability Features

The code will be easier to read and understand for all viewers. The commenting will also prove useful for the debugging.

The change to the next level further develops the game and makes it more entertaining.



### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use |
| ------------- | --- |
|               |     |

### Pseudocode

The pseudocode for ....... is shown below:

<pre><code><strong>Pseudocode here...
</strong></code></pre>

## Development

### Outcome

* The player is now faced with another level after completing the first, the code for this can be viewed below:

```javascript

```

### Challenges

Some challenges I faced during this cycle:

* The platform change was difficult to implement since I didn't know how to move the Sprite very well.

## Testing

Tests performed in this cycle are evidenced below, they were a crucial aspect to my development.

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                                     | What I expect                                                                                   | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code.                                        | The game to start, boundaries rendered, player, Grunts placed and teleporter avaliable for use. | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Move the Player's character into the teleporter. | The Player is moved to the second platform which will later contain more enemies.               | As expected           | Pass      |

### Evidence

The screenshot below shows the commented code, it completes the following tasks for this cycle:

* [x] Comment and tidy up code.
