### Challenges

Some challenges I faced during this cycle:

* Detail was difficult to add since it required me to do some photo editing which I had no real experience of doing.

## Testing

Tests performed in this cycle are evidenced below, they were a crucial aspect to my development.

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                                     | What I expect                                                                                   | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code.                                        | The game to start, boundaries rendered, player, Grunts placed and teleporter avaliable for use. | As expected           | Pass      |
| 2    | Move the Player's character into the teleporter. | The Player is moved to the second platform which will later contain more enemies.               | As expected           | Pass      |
